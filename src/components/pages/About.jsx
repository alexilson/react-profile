            <p>
                I have completed the University of Texas at Austin 6 month Full Stack Web Development bootcamp in March 2024. I have been working in technology since 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was very fun and rewarding, though challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, Sequelize, Object Oriented Programming, Jest, Model-View-Controller, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, MERN.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have experience with Python, Flask, Ginja, Pandas, Microsoft SQL, Excel, VBA, MicroStrategy, Power Automate, PowerBI.
            </p>
            <p>
                I much prefer to work on the backend. I am also pretty into data, database architecture, and data modeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a fully remote worker and am not looking to change that, though I am always open to new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, cooking, festivals, and technology.
